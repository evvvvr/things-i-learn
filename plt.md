  "Quite possibly the most influential set of lecture notes in the history of
  computer science. Left and Right-values, Parametric and Ad-hoc polymorphism were
  all defined in this paper. Much of the content may already occupy your mind,
  but the sheer weight of the heady topics assembled in one place is stunning to
  observe." fogus.

  What is the source of accidental complexity in programming and

  moving whatever remains into relations, and then manipulate said relations
  using a declarative programming language)
